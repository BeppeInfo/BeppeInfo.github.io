Hello. Welcome to this last **GSoC** report.

This is also intended to be a description of my work for submission to **GSoC's Final Evaluation**.

To wrap things up, pencils are down, my code [was submitted to **Scilab**'s review tool](https://codereview.scilab.org/#/c/18489/) for being eventually (I hope so) included into the main tree, and there is one or two new things I want to share with you.

### Code Repositories

First of all, if some of you have interest in taking a better look at my code, it is divided amog two **GitHub** repositories:

- First prototype, when I started developing the kernel as an independent binary (not integrated with **Scilab**'s codebase). This repo is outdated and probably won't receive updates, but could serve as groundwork for someone who wishes to develop a different **Jupyter** kernel (You can always contact me, anyways)

https://github.com/Bitiquinho/Jupyter-Scilab-Kernel

- **Scilab**'s fork containing the integrated **Jupyter** kernel work. This is the repo on which I based my submission and from which I'll further develop the kernel implementation (there are still many little things that should be done)

https://github.com/Bitiquinho/Scilab-Jupyter-Kernel

### Building and Running

For now, as I developed on **Linux**, only the build files for this platform are ready, but I intend to change the **Visual Studio** project files (for compilation on **Windows**) accordingly in the future.

For instructions on how to compile and run it, I set up an [entry at **Scilab Wiki**](https://wiki.scilab.org/GSoC_2016_Leonardo_CONSONI#preview) as part of the required deliverables for this project.

### Jupyter Notebook Usage

On some of my posts I mentioned the possibility of using the web-based **Jupyter Notebook** interface to interact with **Jupyter** kernels. But, up till now, I have been only showing you my results running on **QtConsole** desktop application. So let me convince you that it works for **Notebook** as well.

Assuming that you have set up everything according to the **Wiki entry**, simply run on your terminal:

{% highlight bash %}
$ jupyter notebook
{% endhighlight %}

It'll start a [Jupyter Notebook Server](http://jupyter-notebook.readthedocs.io/en/latest/notebook.html#starting-the-notebook-server) and automatically open a tab on your default web browser running the **Notebook** client:

</p>

Clicking **New** will show a list of the available kernels (the same listed from command line with **jupyter kernelspec list**). We can select **Scilab Native** and wait for it to start in another tab:

</p>

A issued a simple command to see the output, and it looked correct. Keyboard shortcuts are a little different from a typical console (like submitting new code with **Shift+Enter** rather than just **Enter**), but there is [documentation for it](http://jupyter-notebook.readthedocs.io/en/latest/notebook.html#keyboard-shortcuts).


### Final Considerations

I don't want to be a cry baby about it, but the last months were a little tough. I had more academic demands than expected, and needed to conciliate this with performing some significant work on my project every week. But somehow this makes me even more satisfied that I came this far.

Partly because of the reduced work time, there is a lot of missing pieces on the kernel, like handling graphic plots (I'll probably need to deal with the **JVM** for it) and multiple clients (which I have to figure out how, as **Scilab**'s context is a [**singleton**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Singleton_pattern)). But I obviously wish to work on that in the near future, to have a completely functional result.

I don't really know if I'll pass final evaluations by **Google**, but, regardless, I'm really glad for all the coding and development experience I got during these weeks. I'll probably use **ZeroMQ** and **Jupyter** for personal projects, and try to contribute more to **Scilab**, of course.

I really want to thank my mentors for the provided guidance during this work, and all of you who followe this blog posts. 

I expect to see you again soon.
