Hello there,

With **first evaluations** passed (thanks, mentors), and after more time than the ideal, I return to finish our **FMI2**-wrapper computational function.

Exchanging some e-mails and revisiting available **documentation** ([**FMI** specification](https://svn.modelica.org/fmi/branches/public/specifications/v2.0/FMI_for_ModelExchange_and_CoSimulation_v2.0.pdf) is too long to get by looking just one time) made me realize that my previous code was quite incomplete. As I fixed it, I have also updated the related **blog reports** ( [here]({% post_url 2017-06-16-filling_box %}), [here]({% post_url 2017-06-21-events %}) and [here]({% post_url 2017-06-26-continuous %})), keeping this one just for new additions and information.

### Implicit vs Explicit

As it turns out, current **Scilab** implementation treats **Modelica** blocks always as **implicit** (**DAE** based), so that the simulator solver is changed to [**IDA**](https://computation.llnl.gov/projects/sundials/ida) type every time it contains this kind of block. That way, our **derivatives** calculation stage actually will always have to return **residual** values rather than **state time derivatives** themselves.

In **Scicos blocks** case, when dealing with **DAE** solvers, the main **simulator** has to be informed about the nature (**differential** or **algebraic**) of  each state variable. This is defined through **xprop** block field, during calls to the **computational function** with flag **7**.

{% highlight cpp %}
/* ... */

void fmi2_block( scicos_block* block, const int flag )
{
    switch (flag)
    {
        /* ... */
  
        // Flag 7: Define property of continuous time states (algebraic or differential states)
        case ContinuousPropertiesUpdate:
        {       
            for( int i = 0; i < block->nx; i++ )
                block->xprop[ i ] = /* 1 for differential state, -1 for algebraic one*/;
            
            break;
        }
    
        /* ... */
    }
}
{% endhighlight %}

However, the way a **Model Exchange** type **FMU** model libray handles **DAE**s is such that one can't transparently expose this information. As stated in the **documentation**:

- *The FMI for Model Exchange is for ordinary differential equations in state space form (ODE). It is not for a general differential-algebraic equation system. However, algebraic equation systems inside the FMU are supported (for example the FMU can report to the environment to re-run the current step with a smaller step size since a solution could not be found for an algebraic equation system).*

Basically, **algebraic states** aren't exposed to the host application, instead, **algebraic restrictions** would be used to trigger state changes handle internally, while only **differential values** compose the **states array**. That way, our block is presented to the **simulator** as a **ODE**, with all **xprop** values equal to **1**. 

### Entering the [Jacobian] Matrix

Even if a **FMU** model represents a **time continuous system**, things like inputs and other events are applied in discrete steps, causing discontinuities:

<p align="center">

</p>

To handle those jumps recalculating model state, **computational functions** are called with flag **10**, asking for a **matrix** of **states** and **outputs** [**partial derivatives**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Partial_derivative), that compose the system's [**Jacobian matrix**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jacobian_matrix_and_determinant), used by [**KINSOL**](https://computation.llnl.gov/projects/sundials/kinsol) nonlinearity solver.

In practice, here the **partial derivatives** are discrete, representing how much system's functions (**xd=f(u,x,t)**) and outputs (**y=g(u,x,t)**) change from a particular situation, for a small change in each state variable:

And here is the code that was left out of my last post (shame on me !):

{% highlight cpp %}
/* ... */

void fmi2_block( scicos_block* block, const int flag )
{
    switch (flag)
    {
        /* ... */
  
        // Flag 10: Jacobian computation
        case Jacobian:
        {
            fmi2Real dx = 1.0;
            fmi2ValueReference* x_ref = (fmi2ValueReference*) block->work[ STATE_REFS ];
            fmi2Real* xd = (fmi2Real*) block->work[ STATE_DERIV ];
            fmi2ValueReference* xd_ref = (fmi2ValueReference*) block->work[ STATE_DERIV_REFS ];
            
            fmi2Real* yd = (fmi2Real*) block->work[ OUTPUT ];
            fmi2ValueReference* y_ref = (fmi2ValueReference*) block->work[ OUTPUT_REFS ];
            
            // Define input and state for which the derivatives are calcuated
            
            fmi2SetTime( (fmi2Component) block->work[ MODEL ], get_scicos_time() );
            
            set_input( block );
            
            fmi2SetContinuousStates( (fmi2Component) block->work[ MODEL ], block->x, block->nx );
            
            for( int i = 0; i < block->nx; i++ )
            {
                fmi2GetDirectionalDerivative( (fmi2Component) block->work[ MODEL ],
                                              x_ref + i, 1,       // array and number of derivated state references 
                                              xd_ref, block->nx,  // array and number of derivative references
                                              &dx, xd );          // state deltas and resulting state derivatives
                
                // Fill matrix column top with acquired values
                for( int i = 0; i < block->nx; i++ )
                    block->res[ i * block->nx ] = xd[ i ];
                
                fmi2GetDirectionalDerivative( (fmi2Component) block->work[ MODEL ],
                                              x_ref + i, 1,       // array and number of derivated state references 
                                              y_ref, block->nout, // array and number of ouput references
                                              &dx, yd );          // state deltas and resulting output derivatives
                
                // Fill matrix column bottom with acquired values
                int xd_mat_size = block->nx * block->nx;
                for( int i = 0; i < block->nx; i++ )
                    block->res[ xd_mat_size + i * block->nx ] = yd[ i ];
            }
            
            break;
        }
    
        /* ... */
    }
}
{% endhighlight %}


### Wrapping up

That almost concludes what is needed for our **C** computational function. The only thing missing is a way to store in the block the input and output **variables references** (indexes). That would involve taking this information from the **model description XML** file (my next goal, btw), as those values are not always located in the same positions of the real variables list (like states and derivatives).  

Thanks for sticking with me one more time. See Ya !
