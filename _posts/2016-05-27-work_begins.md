May 23 marked the beginning of **Coding Period** for **GSoC**. [As I wasn't kicked due to my lack of communication] That means it's time to do some real work on my project.

Sorry for the late manifestation. Breaking the inertia and start coding is some difficult task for a lazy reactive person like me. I'm just glad to be able to start with a clean codebase, rather than having to dive deep into other developers code, as it would make my laziness escalate. On the other hand, this requires that I have to figure out how to do the groundwork by myself. 

Well, not actually. Some research brings me to the thought: 

**I just love the Internet. It helps you to look smart when you definitely aren't.**

The Web is so full of knowledge resources (and dumb things too)... That includes information provided by people who previously built **Jupyter** kernels, those precursor heroes, like [Doug](https://github.com/dsblank/simple_kernel) and [Andrew](http://andrew.gibiansky.com/blog/ipython/ipython-kernels/), who paved the way for the following developers. Your references are surely apreciated here, gentlemen.

Oh, I can't forget to mention the rich [Jupyter developer documentation](http://jupyter-client.readthedocs.io/en/latest/kernels.html) as well.

So, as [Antoine Lavoisier](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antoine_Lavoisier) would say (in my recently "learned" French):

>"Dans la nature rien ne se crÃ©e, rien ne se perd, tout change"

Or, as most of you may know:

>"In nature nothing is created, nothing is lost, everything changes"

That kind of natural transformation will guide me to achive my GSoC goal.

Let's move on...
