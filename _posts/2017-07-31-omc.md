Hey, I'm back

After passing **GSoC's Second Evaluation** (barely, I must say, as I haven't presented concrete results yet), I decided to write about some short but important topic that I've been postponing for a while.

**OpenModelica** is a huge project, with many tools apart from the compiler itself, and using the entire package as a dependency for **Modelica** support inside **Scilab** would be overkill. Even **OMCompiler** itself has some optional features that are unneeded for that task.

That said, providing a way to build a minimal version of **OMCompiler**, just enough to create **FMU** packages, is very desirable.

### In a Nutshell

Compiling **OMCompiler** requires the standard [**autoconf** and **automake**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Automake) tools, easily found in **Linux** distributions repositories and also available for **Windows** through [**MSYS2**](http://www.msys2.org/).

System configurations (e.g. standard [paths](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PATH_(variable))) aside, the building process (for **git** version) can be resumed as:

{% highlight bash %}
$ git clone --recursive https://github.com/OpenModelica/OMCompiler.git
$ cd OMCompiler
$ export CPPFLAGS="$CPPFLAGS -DH5_USE_18_API"
$ ./configure --prefix=/install/path --with-ombuilddir=/binaries/output/path --without-METIS --without-FMIL --without-UMFPACK --disable-non-free-packages --without-lpsolve
$ make omc-no-sim
$ make install
{% endhighlight %}

Notice that **OMCompiler** is not yet ported to [**HDF5**](https://support.hdfgroup.org/HDF5/) **1.10** API, so we must request usage of the old one through **compilation flags** (thanks to the creator of [this bug report](https://trac.openmodelica.org/OpenModelica/ticket/3945)). Also, selecting **omc-no-sim** build target removes the need for standalone simulation dependencies like [**CORBA**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_Object_Request_Broker_Architecture) and [**SUNDIALS**](https://computation.llnl.gov/projects/sundials) libraries.


That's all for now. See you soon.
