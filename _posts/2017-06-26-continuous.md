Hey, I'm back !

If you've been following my progress reports, it may seem that I'm not doing much, in view of the little code I show here.

Although I also feel lagging behind a bit, one thing I suspected since the beginning (and realized even more now) is that this project is much less about spending time twisting screws than understanding which screws should be twisted... If you know what I mean.

Even if we're leveraging **third-party** tools to perform simulation work in **Xcos**, it's necessary to have a clear idea of how they work, so that we can provide their routines the correct information and connect them properly inside **Scilab**'s code. That involves trying to wrap your head around documentation from different projects, and even reading the current implementation code to know the way it is supposed to be done.

On one side, we have automatically generated code for simulation of different dynamical systems, exposed through a common and defined **FMI2** interface, already presented here. On the other hand, **Xcos** simulator takes, on each iteration step, state information from every **Scicos** block and shove it on one of the available [**SUNDIALS**](https://computation.llnl.gov/projects/sundials) numerical solvers to update model outputs.

### Differential/algebraic equations

Depending on the type of solver used, mathematical representation of the model could assume 2 distinct formats: [**Ordinary Differential Equations**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ordinary_differential_equation) (**ODE**s) or [**Differential-Algebraic Equations**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Differential_algebraic_equation) (**DAE**s).

Roughly speaking, **ODE**s are systems of equations that could be organized in the form:

<p align="center">
  <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?{x}'&space;=&space;f(t,x)">
</p>

With the **state derivative** **x'** explicitly defined for every variable, given the current **x** value (which in turn is generally a function of the independent time variable **t**), numerical integration could be easily performed to obtain simulation results.

In cases where **x'** is not known, can't be expressed only in terms of **t** and **x** or there are numerical constraints involved, the model equations must be described in a more generalized **DAE** format:

<p align="center">
  <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?F(t,x,x')&space;=&space;0">
</p>

That way, solving the system implies finding **state derivatives** that minimize **F(t,x,x')** value, called [**residual**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Residual_(numerical_analysis)). In other words, this method deals with **approximate solutions**.

**DAE**s could be converted to a system of coupled **ODE**s through [index reduction](http://reference.wolfram.com/language/tutorial/NDSolveDAE.html#128085219), but solver calculations would be more costly than using a specific algorithm for [index-1](http://reference.wolfram.com/language/tutorial/NDSolveDAE.html#1195304774) **DAE**s. Thereby, it is interesting to support **differential-algebraic** solvers ([**IDA**](https://computation.llnl.gov/projects/sundials/ida), [**KINSOL**](https://computation.llnl.gov/projects/sundials/kinsol), etc.) as well as **ordinary differential** ones ([**CVODE**](https://computation.llnl.gov/projects/sundials/cvode), [**ARKode**](https://computation.llnl.gov/projects/sundials/arkode), etc.).

### Scicos continuous state update jobs

For **Scicos** blocks computational function, there are 3 flags related to continuous time state updates:

<table style="width:100%">
  <tr> <th>flags</th> <th>inputs                                </th> <th>  outputs   </th> <th>description                                    </th> </tr>
  <tr> <td>  0  </td> <td>t, nevprt, x, z, inptr, mode, phase   </td> <td>  xd, res   </td> <td>compute the derivative of continuous time state</td> </tr>
  <tr> <td>  1  </td> <td>t, nevprt, x, z, inptr, mode, phase   </td> <td>  outptr    </td> <td>compute the outputs of the block               </td> </tr>
  <tr> <td> ... </td> <td>                  ...                 </td> <td>    ...     </td> <td>                      ...                      </td> </tr>
  <tr> <td> 10  </td> <td>t, nevprt, x, z, inptr, mode, phase   </td> <td>    res     </td> <td>compute jacobian matrix                        </td> </tr>
</table>

*(It's worth noting that by "continuous" here I mean "not triggered by events", as we can't really have continuous change in a computer calculation, just discrete updates after regular time steps)*

</p>

Jobs **0** and **1** are described in [the documentation](http://www.scicos.org/Newblock.pdf), respectively, as:

- *Integrator calls: This job is called when flag=0. In this case, the simulation function computes the derivative state x_dot and place its value in the address provided by the blockâ€™s structure.*

- *This job is called when flag=1, it is called only if the block has regular ports. In this case, the simulator requests the values of the outputs. The computational function uses the information given by the block structure to calculate the output and put it at the address given by the block structure. If the block contains different mode then the calculation depends on the simulation phase.*

At first, I couldn't find information regarding job **10**, that computes the [**Jacobian**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jacobian_matrix_and_determinant) derivatives matrix used by some solvers. It was not mentioned in that document, and common (explicit) **Scicos** blocks do not implement it. So I had to look at blocks generated by current **modelicac** compiler to understand what it returns, e.g.:

{% highlight cpp %}
void BouncingBall_Modelica_im(scicos_block *block, int flag)
{
	double *rpar = block->rpar;
	double *x = block->x;
	double *xd = block->xd;
	double **y = block->outptr;
	double *res = block->res;
	
	/* ... */

	/* Intermediate variables */
	double v0;

	if (flag == DerivativeState) {             // Flag 0
		res[0] = xd[0]-x[1];
		res[1] = rpar[0]+xd[1];
	} else if (flag == OutputUpdate) {         // Flag 1
		if (get_phase_simulation() == 1) {
			y[0][0] = x[0]; /* OutPutPort1.vo */
			y[1][0] = x[1]; /* OutPutPort2.vo */
		} else {
			y[0][0] = x[0]; /* OutPutPort1.vo */
			y[1][0] = x[1]; /* OutPutPort2.vo */
		}
	/* ... */
	} else if (flag == Jacobian) {             // Flag 10
		v0 = Get_Jacobian_parameter();
		res[0] = v0;
		res[1] = 0.0;
		res[2] = -1.0;
		res[3] = v0;
		res[4] = 1.0;
		res[5] = 0.0;
		res[6] = 0.0;
		res[7] = 1.0;
		set_block_error(0);
	}

	return;
}
{% endhighlight %}

Where I found strange that, for either **DerivativeState** and **Jacobian** jobs, the residual **res** is being returned rather than **xd**. Further investigation led me to another [design document](http://www.scicos.org/Formation_scicos_mars_2008.pdf) that asserts:

- *block->xd: Array of doubles of size [nx,1] corresponding to the derivative of the continuous state register. It is an output of the simulation function if the block is an explicit block, i.e. the block models a system of Ordinary Differential Equations (ODE), otherwise, it is an input. In the latter case, the output is the residual vector res associated with a system of Differential Algebraic Equations (DAE).*

- *block.xd: a vector of size nx giving the value of the derivative continuous state register. Values of the derivative continuous state register will be saved in the C structure of the block only for flag=4, flag=6, flag=0 and flag=2.*

- *block.res: a vector of size nx corresponding to the Differential Algebraic Equation (DAE) residual. Values of that register will be saved in the C structure of the block only for flag=0, and flag=10*

From that we can deduce that flag **0** has deal with **xd** input and **res** output or only **xd** output, while flag **10** will always output **res**. This is confirmed by inspecting the main simulator code, in **scicos.c** (not shown here for readability).

So, with things figured out, we can finally implement those jobs in our **FMI2** wrapper:

{% highlight cpp %}
/* ... */

// Utility function for setting Scicos block -> FMI2 model input
static void set_input(scicos_block* block)
{
    // Considering input only floating point continuous values
    double** u = (double**) block->inptr;
    fmi2Real* input = (fmi2Real*) block->work[ INPUT ];
    fmi2ValueReference* input_refs = (fmi2ValueReference*) block->work[ INPUT_REFS ];
    // Set u inputs before calculation derivatives
    for( int i = 0; i < block->nin; i++ )
        input[ i ] = u[ i ][ 0 ];
    fmi2SetReal( (fmi2Component) block->work[ MODEL ], input_refs, block->nin, input );
}

// Utility function for getting FMI2 model -> Scicos block output
static void get_output(scicos_block* block)
{
    // Considering output only floating point continuous values
    double** y = (double**) block->outptr;
    fmi2Real* output = (fmi2Real*) block->work[ INPUT ];
    fmi2ValueReference* output_refs = (fmi2ValueReference*) block->work[ INPUT_REFS ];
    // Retrieve output values
    if( fmi2GetReal( (fmi2Component) block->work[ MODEL ], output_refs, block->nout, output ) == fmi2OK )
    {
        // Setting outputs the same as continuous states
        for( int i = 0; i < block->nout; i++ )
            y[ i ][ 0 ] = output[ i ];
    }
    
    // For now, we assume no discrete outputs
}

/* ... */

void fmi2_block( scicos_block* block, const int flag )
{
    switch (flag)
    {
        /* ... */
  
        // Flag 0: Update continuous state
        case DerivativeState:
        {
            fmi2SetTime( (fmi2Component) block->work[ MODEL ], get_scicos_time() );
            
            set_input( block );
            
            // Get state time derivatives
            fmi2Real* x_dot = (fmi2Real*) block->work[ STATE_DERIV ];
            fmi2GetDerivatives( (fmi2Component) block->work[ MODEL ], x_dot, block->nx );
            
            // Output both residuals for implicit (DAE) solvers
            for( int i = 0; i < block->nx; i++ )
            {
                block->res[ i ] = x_dot[ i ] - block->xd[ i ];
                // When using DAE solvers, xd and res point to same array, 
                // so use this to prevent overriding the residual (only set derivatives for ODEs)
                if( block->res != block->xd ) block->xd[ i ] = x_dot[ i ];
            }
            
            break;
        }

        /* ... */
    
        // Flag 1: Update output state
        case OutputUpdate:
        {
            fmi2SetTime( (fmi2Component) block->work[ MODEL ], get_scicos_time() );
            
            set_input( block );
            
            get_output( block );
            
            break;
        }
    
        case Jacobian:
        {
            // (To be implemented)

            break;
        }
    
        /* ... */
    }
}
{% endhighlight %}


Wow ! That was a rather long post. I hope it was enough to explain things for now.

Also sorry for the current rough implementation. I'm in a hurry with first **GSoC** evaluations, but I do plan to update the publication later with more detailed code.

Thanks for sticking with me one more time. See Ya !
