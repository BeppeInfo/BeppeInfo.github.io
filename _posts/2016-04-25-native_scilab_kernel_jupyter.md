(Before we start, I must say that, according to GSoC [calendar](https://developers.google.com/open-source/gsoc/timeline), the program is now at the **Community Bonding** period, not the coding phase itself. So, I really should be talking to the devs instead of writing ego-feeding hype posts, lol.

Anyways, let's move on.)
