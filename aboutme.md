My name is Leonardo José Consoni. I'm currently a Master's Degree Engineering student from the University of São Paulo, in Brazil.

I'm interested in or work with:

- Computer programming (duh)
- Open-Source software/hardware (too mainstream)
- Bioengineering/Rehabilitation Engineering (somehow related to the first two)
- Military History (wait, what ?)
- A little Philosophy (ok, now that's getting weird...)
